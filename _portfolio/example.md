I wanted to see if there is any coorelation whatsoever between a player's Twitter followers and their respect salary, number of wins, and points scored. I started by downloading the dataset that I got from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/noahgift/social-power-nba).

Using pyplot scatterplot, I found these results:
pyplot scatterplot where the x axis is salary in millions and the y axis is Twitter followers in millions
