So let's start with the basic idea. I first wanted to create a Discord bot that could give me random quotes from Joko Widodo (don't ask why). After that's done, I was bored and decided to add even more features. Here's all of them as of July 2021.

1. Joko Widodo Random Quote Generator.

2. National Heroes Random Quote Generator

3. Ping and 8ball minigame

4. Reddit (supports all subreddits!)

5. Image manipulation (works with all images)

6. Talk with an AI

7. A custom help page

That's all for now.
